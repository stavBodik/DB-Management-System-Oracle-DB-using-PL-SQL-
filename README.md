  <br><br>
  This project was implemented during Oracle DB course at <a href="https://english.afeka.ac.il/">Afeka Academic College of Engineering.</a>
  <br><br>
  The main idea of the project was to create a DB management system where the user can run different queries edit,create and manage DB tables.
  <br>
  I chose to implement the project on a known MMORPG game,creating and thinking about the tables structures and the connections between them done by me.
  <br><br>
  While developing this project one of the most important constraint was to write a code on the client side while it doesn't includes any line of SQL code,
  <br>
  This means that all the DB calculations are done on the server side and sent back to the client.
  <br><br>
  The requirements of the project required implementing complicated DB functions,procedures and queries which was done using <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/plsql.html">
    PL/SQL
  </a>,
  <br>
  One of them which really impressed the lecturer and none of the students implement was a generic function which converts any table to a string,
  <br>
  This means that in the client side I can call this function with any table structure and get a string of a table and then I can parse and view it to the user.
  <br><br>
  The project implements :
  <br><br>
  1. Use of <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/"> JDBC MySQL Connector</a> in order to create and communicate with the DB.
  <br>
  2. <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/plsql.html">PL/SQL</a>
  <br>
  3. MVC (Model View Control) Architecture.
